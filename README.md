### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. This lesson discussed Markdown and how adding nonalphabetical characters can drastically change the look and style of text. Markdown can create numbered lists, bulleted lists, bolld text, italic texts and much more. 
2. Learned about and how to execute if/else commands. In the assignment, code is used to calculate tax based on the "if" statement entered by the user. The user will insert their taxable income and "if" it is below a certain amount then a distinct calculation is used.
3. This lesson discussed the onClick button. Implimenting this into code enables a certain event to occur when a button is clicked. In this assignment, when the "clear calculator" button is pressed it reverts filing status back to "single," taxable income to "0" and resets the summary below the calculator.
